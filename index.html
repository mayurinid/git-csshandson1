<h3>What is CSS?</h3>
<div class="linesp">
    <ol>
    <li> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. </li>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed  on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
    <li><span class="sp1">Css is not necessary</span><span class="sp2">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
    <div class="txtudr"><li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </div>
</ol>
</div  >
<h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
<div class="lettersp" >
    <ul>
        <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal-by using a style elements in the head section. </li>
        <li>External-by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>the most common way to add CSS, is to link to an external CSS files. However, <span class="sp2" >bthis tutorial we will use inline  and internal styles, </span>beacuse this is easier to demonstrate, and easier  for you to try it yourself. </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.</p>
<p>In CSS, Selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element</p>
<p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two od the most commonly used are class and ID. Both target elements to which a style should be applied </p>
